I developed a movie application that uses  RESTful API with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose with CRUD functionalities.
I have created a proper front end using bootstrap,html,css. I have added proper authentication  using JWT and password validations.
All CRUD operations from the MONGO DB using Mongoose. I have used tools like Atlas, Postman, ThunderClient for creating this project.
